# Eventival migration assistant

Hello!

This is a quick and dirty application to help you transfer your StarBase Contact information to Eventival.

It will merge the contact information for people with the same name, and also merge all of the contact cards of a single person together.

To run, please set up the database connection info in Main.java, and use the following maven commands:

```
mvn compiler:compile
mvn exec:java
```

Coming soon:
- photo transfer
- films transfer

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at ali@pro.ba
